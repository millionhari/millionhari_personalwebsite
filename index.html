      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack engineer with a background in multimedia development. Creating is what I am passionate about, whether that be in the form of software, hardware, or art. Computers, cameras, and technology make me giddy with excitement.

      <p>
        My software engineering journey started naturally when I was deep in the multimedia arts. It became apparent to me that the web was the form of media that people most commonly consumed, so I began to teach myself coding. I eventually left my job as a multimedia developer to be a programmer full time, and have since built numerous full-stack projects and web apps.

        I am currently based in San Francisco. but am open to work in the greater Los Angeles area.
